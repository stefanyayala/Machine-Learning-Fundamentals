# Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Projects Repository**! This repository contains various machine learning projects showcasing fundamental and advanced concepts in predictive modeling, classification, and data analysis. The projects included in this repository utilize a variety of datasets, algorithms, and evaluation techniques, offering a hands-on approach to understanding key principles of machine learning. Key topics:  
- Supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification)  
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering)  
- Decision trees and classification models  

Below is an overview of the projects contained in this repository:

## Projects

### 1. **[Carseats Predictive Models](carseats-predictive-models/README.md)**
This project involves building predictive models to estimate sales based on various features like price, advertising budget, and location. The goal is to predict car seat sales in different markets using regression techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation, with a focus on interpreting model results for business decisions.

**Key Concepts**:
- Predictive modeling
- Linear regression
- Feature selection and importance
- Model evaluation

### 2. **[Wine Quality Prediction](wine-data-classification/README.md)**
This project analyzes a wine dataset to classify wine quality using decision trees. The analysis includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, building and evaluating decision trees with different splitting criteria, pruning the trees for improved generalization, and deriving insights from important variables.

**Key Concepts**:
- Decision trees for classification
- Data splitting (70-30)
- Model evaluation and pruning
- Feature importance visualization

### 3. **[Pima Indian Diabetes Classification](pima-diabetes-classification/README.md)**
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using the **Pima Indian Diabetes dataset**. It focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building classification models to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The models evaluated include OneR and Decision Trees.

**Key Concepts**:
- Data preprocessing (outlier detection, imputation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification models (OneR, Decision Tree)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

### 4. **[German Credit Risk Prediction](german-credit-prediction/README.md)**
This project demonstrates a predictive analysis pipeline aimed at assessing customer credit risk using the **German Credit dataset**. The analysis focuses on binary classification to assess creditworthiness (Good vs. Bad) based on socio-economic and credit-related factors. The models built include Decision Trees and Random Forests.

**Key Concepts**:
- Binary classification
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Feature importance
- Model comparison and evaluation
