# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository is a collection of my data science and machine learning projects using R and Python. The projects demonstrate various techniques and algorithms applied to different datasets. They include:  
- Supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification)  
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering)  
- Decision trees and classification models  

In R, these projects are built using packages like caret, rpart, and randomForest. In Python, I am transitioning to frameworks like PyTorch, scikit-learn, and pandas.

**-- Project Status: Active**

### Features  
1. *Reproducible Code*: Clean, modular scripts in R and Python.  
2. *Learning Resources*: Examples of regression, classification, and clustering.  
3. *Transition to Python*: Projects showing my learning path as I move from R to Python.
